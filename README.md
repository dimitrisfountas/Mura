# Mura
MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs) is a large dataset of bone X-rays.
We are tasked with finding the appropriate algorithm that determines whether an X-ray study is normal or abnormal.
This project focuses only on the wrist studies using a Transfer Learning Approach.
<strong> Please Refer to the "Mura Report.pdf" for more information about the Selection Criteria used while Chosing our Model.<\strong>
